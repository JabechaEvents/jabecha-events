# Jabecha Events – Development Session Progress

_Last updated: {{DATE}}_

## Overview
This session established the foundational React Native (Expo SDK 53) codebase for **Jabecha Events** and delivered a working authentication flow backed by Firebase. We also set up theming, UI primitives, navigation guards, and a basic Home screen with logout capability.

---

## Key Milestones Completed

### 1  Project Initialization
* Generated Expo project (`npx create-expo-app`) and upgraded to **SDK 53**.
* Installed core navigation & Expo Router packages already included in template.
* Added **expo-build-properties** plugin to inject `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS).

### 2  Theming & UI System
* Created `src/theme/theme.ts` with custom Material You (MD3) Paper theme, palette, font config, and `version: 3` flag.
* Installed **react-native-paper**, `react-native-vector-icons`, and `react-native-safe-area-context`.
* Added reusable UI primitives in `src/components/ui/`:
  * `JButton`
  * `JInput`
  * `JScreen` (SafeArea wrapper + padding)
* Wrapped root layout with `PaperProvider` using the custom theme.

### 3  State Management / Utilities
* Installed supporting libs: `zustand`, `@tanstack/react-query`, `react-hook-form`, `zod`, `expo-secure-store`.
* Adjusted `tsconfig.json` path aliases and ensured TypeScript passes (`tsc --noEmit`).

### 4  Firebase Integration
* Added `src/firebase/firebase.ts` initializing Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage) with provided config.
* Installed `firebase` SDK.
* Added Google services files reference via build-properties plugin.

### 5  Authentication Layer
* Built `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` exposing `signIn`, `signUp`, `signOut`, `resetPassword`, with listener for auth state.
* Wrapped root layout (`app/_layout.tsx`) with `AuthProvider` and created `AuthNavigator` for conditional routing.
* Added Auth stack routes under `app/(auth)/`:
  * `login.tsx`
  * `signup.tsx`
  * `forgot.tsx`
* Forms use **React-Hook-Form + Zod** validation and Paper inputs.
* Successful login/signup now triggers `router.replace('/')` to enter main app.

### 6  Home Screen
* Replaced template `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` with minimal Home screen greeting the user and offering **Log Out** (calls `signOut`).

### 7  Polish & UX
* Added consistent vertical spacing (`marginBottom`) across auth inputs & buttons.
* Ensured compile clean (no TS errors) after all edits.

## Next Up
1. **Profile Screen** – display & update user info, avatar upload via Firebase Storage.
2. **Event Management (Phase 3)** – CRUD UI, Firestore rules, PDF program builder.
3. Unit & E2E tests (Jest + Detox) and CI pipeline with GitHub Actions.
